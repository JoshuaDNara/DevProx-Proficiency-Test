# Devprox Proficiency Test 

Thank you for taking the time to attempt this test. As a business we encourage
innovative thinking and initiative. In these tests before you we are looking for those
elements but we are strongly urging that you consider what has been asked for.
Anything above what is asked is a bonus but due to time constraints may hinder your
progress. The test should be conducted in any language you are familiar and
proficient with. On completion submit to Github repository. Make sure you have
given us the necessary instructions to deploy your solution, if you use a specific
database ensure that we will be able to get it running.

## Test 1

Create an HTML form with the following input fields to allow for the capturing of
data into a database:
Name, Surname, Id No, Date of Birth, POST button, CANCEL button
Create a database with a relevant schema to store the input fields in.




## Test 2

This task is to test your skills in manipulating arrays and file handling.
In this test you will be making a CSV file of variable length, a form will ask for the
amount of data to generate. Check the requirements on how to generate the file.
The file will have the following header fields
Id, Name, Surname, Initials, Age, DateOfBirth
The data will look like this
"1","Andre","van Zuydam", "A", "33","13/02/1979"
"2","Tyron James", "Hall", "TJ", "32", "03/06/1980";
After this you will import the file into a database and output a count of all the
records imported.
